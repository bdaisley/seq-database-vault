## A collection of pre-formatted taxonomic reference database files

The purpose of this repository is to act as a central storage space for universal database files that have been pre-formatted for various purposes related to taxonomic annotation of high-throughput sequencing reads in microbiome studies.

Commands used to process each database from its original state are provided in the README.md file of each sub-directory.
